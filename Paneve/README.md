These are presentations that were done while I was an employee at Paneve Inc.

These were good times!

------------------

big-data-hadoop.ppt - A presentation that I created that talks about big data and it uses.
		      In addition, it walks the user through the use of Pig, HDFS, and Amazon Web Services.

install-sw-leaf-v709.ppt - A presentation that covers how to build U-Boot and install it on our new processor.

uboot-verify.pdf - This document covers the verification process for our new CPU, called SEP.
		   I was tasked with taking my work with U-Boot and creating a process whereby
		   we could test the ASIC.

Zetta_ABI.odt	- A very, very early version of the ABI that I started to create for our ISA. This is very rough. But, an ABI is so important when creating a new processor.
